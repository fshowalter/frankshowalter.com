1. Study @SPEC.md
2. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
3. Study @progress.txt
4. Pick the higest value task from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN and implement.
5. Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN
6. Update @progress.txt
7. Commit changes.
8. Exit
9. ONLY WORK ON ONE TASK AT A TIME

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to @progress.txt (never replace, always append):

## [Date/Time] - [task name]

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")

---

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.
