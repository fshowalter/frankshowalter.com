1. Important: If you try and use a tool that requires permission, immediately print the request, including the required change to settings.json necessary to enable it, then exit.
2. Study @SPEC.md
3. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
4. Study @progress.txt
5. Pick the higest value task from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN and implement.
6. Update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN
7. Update @progress.txt
8. Commit changes.
9. Exit
10. ONLY WORK ON ONE TASK AT A TIME

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to @progress.txt (never replace, always append):

## [Date/Time] - [task name]

- What was implemented
- Files changed
- Missing permissions (what tools did you try to use but couldn't?)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")

---

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.
